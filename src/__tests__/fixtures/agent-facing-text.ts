/**
 * THE REVIEWED TEXT OF EVERY AGENT-FACING STRING THIS MCP SHIPS.
 *
 * Every tool's top-level `description` and every `inputSchema` property description in
 * `buildToolList()`, split into sentences. A host LLM reads all of it and spends the user's money
 * according to what it says, so this file is the structural backstop that makes a change to any of
 * it a REVIEWED change rather than an incidental one (R11-M02). It lives beside the suite rather
 * than inside `tool-registration.test.ts` only for size: the assertions, and the semantic guards
 * that explain WHY a sentence would be unsafe, are all in that test.
 *
 * WHEN A SNAPSHOT TEST FAILS AFTER A DELIBERATE EDIT, do not paste the new text in and move on.
 * Re-run the semantic guards' REASONING over every changed sentence first:
 *   - no path may say the fee WAS taken, or was NOT taken, where it cannot know (SPEC.md §6,
 *     REQ-19e/f);
 *   - no branch where money may have moved may carry a retry endorsement;
 *   - no indeterminate state may be described as progressing, queued, or succeeded (SPEC.md
 *     REQ-19b as amended in R11-M03).
 * Only then update the entry here.
 *
 * Generated once from the implementation and reviewed by hand; regenerating it blindly defeats its
 * entire purpose.
